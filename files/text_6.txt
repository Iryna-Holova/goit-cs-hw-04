HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create and design web pages. It provides a structured format for organizing content on the web, using a system of tags and attributes to define elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and forms. HTML documents are interpreted by web browsers to render the visual layout and structure of a webpage. Along with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and JavaScript for interactivity, HTML forms the foundation of the World Wide Web. With the evolution of HTML5, new features like video and audio support, canvas for graphics, and semantic elements have been introduced, enhancing the capabilities of web development.
