JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a versatile programming language primarily used for client-side web development. It enables developers to create dynamic and interactive elements within web pages, such as animations, pop-ups, and form validations. JavaScript is also commonly used in server-side development with platforms like Node.js, allowing developers to build scalable and efficient web applications. With its asynchronous capabilities and event-driven model, JavaScript is well-suited for handling real-time user interactions and managing complex workflows. Its extensive ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, including React, Angular, and Vue.js, empowers developers to build modern and feature-rich web applications.
