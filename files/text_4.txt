JavaScript is a high-level programming language commonly used for creating interactive web pages and web applications. It is a versatile language that can be executed in web browsers, servers, and even embedded in hardware. JavaScript enables developers to add dynamic behavior to websites, such as form validation, interactive maps, and animated graphics. With the rise of frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js, JavaScript has become essential for building modern web applications. Its asynchronous nature and event-driven architecture make it suitable for handling user interactions in real-time.
