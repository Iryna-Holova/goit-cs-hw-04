HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the foundation of web development, providing a standardized markup language for creating and structuring web pages. It consists of a set of tags and attributes that define the structure and content of a webpage, including text, images, links, and multimedia elements. HTML documents are interpreted by web browsers to render the visual layout and presentation of a webpage. HTML5, the latest version of HTML, introduces new features and enhancements such as semantic elements, multimedia support, canvas for drawing graphics, and improved accessibility options. With its simplicity and compatibility with other web technologies like CSS and JavaScript, HTML remains an essential tool for building websites and web applications.
